# Note
I forked this repository in an attempt at creating a machine learning algorithm that would differentiate between whether an item should go into the recycling, compost, or trash bin. Although I did this successfully on my local computer, I was unable to replicate it on Heroku due to a dependancy malfunction. There were also other issues, such as Heroku's cold start creating large latency for the user. Therefore, I switched to using Tensorflow, where I was successfully able to create an accurate ML algorithm. Due to the abandonment of this project, I have chosen to archive it.
